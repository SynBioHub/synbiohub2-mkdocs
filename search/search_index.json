Sharing designs between instances of SynBioHub is also further facilitated via the Web of Registries service.

If you check this option, then you'll also have the option of choosing the frequency of index update.</li> <li>Then, you have the option of whether you want to allow the option of a distributed search or not.</li> <li>Subsequently, you can select the value of page rank tolerance. PageRank is an algorithm that measures the transitive influence or connectivity of nodes. It can be computed by either iteratively distributing one node's rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbors or by randomly traversing the graph and counting the frequency of hitting each node during these walks.</li> <li>There is also an option of choosing a value of UClust clustering identity. UCLUST is an algorithm designed to cluster nucleotide or amino-acid sequences into clusters based on sequence similarity. The algorithm was published in 2010 and implemented in a program also named UCLUST. The algorithm is described by the author as following two simple clustering criteria, in regard to the requested similarity threshold T. The first criterion states that any given cluster's centroid sequence will have a similarity smaller than T to any other cluster's centroid sequence. The second criterion states that each member sequence in a given cluster will have similarity to the cluster's centroid sequence that is equal or greater than T.</li> <li>Then you can also input a value for the Elasticsearch endpoints. For applications without SSL or HTTPS protocol support, you can use a local endpoint with the HTTP protocol, which in turn connects to your Elastic Cloud Enterprise cluster or to Kibana either using the HTTP or the HTTPS protocol.</li> <li>Finally, you have to input a value for the SPARQL/Virtuoso endpoints. A Virtuoso SPARQL Endpoint is a feature of every Virtuoso RDBMS instance that offers an HTTP-based Query Service that operates on Entity Relationship Types (Relations) represented as RDF sentence collections using the SPARQL Query Language. These operations may be read- and/or write-oriented and distributed without compromising security, performance, or scalability.</li> <li>Then, click on the save button to save all the details for SBOLExplorer.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2_micro_guides/Administration/#69-sparql","title":"6.9 SPARQL","text":"<p>This page can be used by administrators to perform any SPARQL query or update.

Definition and MapsTo 1) Definition: The definition property is a REQUIRED URI that refers to the ComponentDefinition of the ComponentInstance. ComponentDefinition effectively provides information about the types and roles of the ComponentInstance.  2) MapsTo: When ComponentDefinition and ModuleDefinition objects are composed into structural and functional hierarchies using ComponentInstance and Module objects, it is often the case that some ComponentInstance objects are intended to represent the same entity in the overall design. The purpose of the MapsTo class is to make these identity relationships clear and explicit. For example, consider a ModuleDefinition for a genetic inverter that includes a FunctionalComponent for an abstract repressor protein. When this ModuleDefinition is instantiated within a \u201chigher level\u201d ModuleDefinition that includes a FunctionalComponent for a LacI protein, the MapsTo object can be used to indicate that the repressor protein in the first ModuleDefinition is LacI in the context of the composite design. Public and Inout 1) Public: Indicates that a ComponentInstance MAY be referred to by remote MapsTo objects. 2) Inout: Indicates that the FunctionalComponent is both an input and output. <p>Subsequently, just below the functional components, we have the Interactions section. Interaction basically provides a more detailed description of how the FunctionalComponent objects of a ModuleDefinition are intended to work together. It has a table consisting of the following attributes:</p> Name Description Interaction/Participation 1) Interaction: Provides more detailed description of how the FunctionalComponent objects of a ModuleDefinition are intended to work together.   2) Participation: Each Participation represents how a particular FunctionalComponent behaves in its parent Interaction. Participant Definition The definition property is a REQUIRED URI that refers to the ComponentDefinition of the ComponentInstance. As described in the previous section, this ComponentDefinition effectively provides information about the types and roles of the ComponentInstance. Type/Role 1) Type: Specifies the category of biochemical or physical entity. For example DNA, protein, or small molecule that a ComponentDefinition object abstracts for the purpose of engineering design. For DNA or RNA entities, additional types fields are used to describe nucleic acid topology (circular / linear) and strandedness (double- or single-stranded).  2) Role: Clarifies the potential function of an entity in a biochemical or physical context. When it is used for ComponentDefinitions, it MUST identify terms from ontologies that are consistent with the types property of the ComponentDefinition. For example, the roles property of a DNA or RNA ComponentDefinition could contain URIs identifying terms from the Sequence Ontology (SO).

Note that the docker website has a tutorial with mor information.</li> </ul> <p>How to dockerise plugin code (things in &lt;&gt; signs should be replaced with your specific variable names) 1. Run command window as admin. 2. git clone the github repository containing everything into a local directory:  <code>git clone &lt;github url&gt;</code>. 3. cd into directory that was just cloned: <code>cd &lt;directory name&gt;</code> 4. create a file named <code>.dockerignore</code> with the contents \"Dockerfile\": <code>echo Dockerfile&gt;.dockerignore</code>. 5. create a file named \"Dockerfile\": <code>echo &gt;Dockerfile</code> 6. Edit the Dockerfile to contain the appropriate text (I use notepad++ for this - note for python plugins a requirements.txt is required and for js plugins a package.json file is required) 7. Build your docker image: <code>docker build --tag synbiohub/&lt;descriptive name&gt;:snapshot</code>. (Note the full stop at the end of the command!) 8. Run the docker image: <code>docker run --publish &lt;port number&gt;:5000 --detach --name &lt;short name&gt; synbiohub/&lt;descriptive name&gt;:snapshot</code> 9. Check the run was sucessful: <code>docker ps</code>,  if not shown there check: <code>docker ps -all</code>  and then check the logs: <code>docker logs &lt;short name&gt;</code> 10. Based on error logs fix the errors, then remove the current container: <code>docker rm &lt;short name&gt;</code> and repeat steps 7 and 8. 11. If docker ps shows your plugin running then navigate to localhost:/status. Can also test the run end point using a program like postman to submit a query and look at the response. 12. If all is well stop the docker container:  <code>docker stop &lt;short name&gt;</code> and remove it <code>docker rm &lt;short name&gt;</code> 13. Upload the newly added files (Dockerfile and .dockerignore) to the github repo 14. Add github action to push image to dockerhub (called <code>release.yml</code> in my plugins) 15. Under <code>setting&gt;secrets</code> add secrets containing the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> 16. Update the readme and wait for the new image to be pushed to docker hub (you will see a green check next to commit when this has happened) 17. check the uploaded image works by downloading and running it: <code>docker run --publish 8080:5000 --detach --name &lt;short name&gt; synbiohub/&lt;descriptive name&gt;:snapshot</code> and repeating steps 9-12.</p>"},{"location":"3_advanced/plugins/#9-plugins-table","title":"9.

SynBioHub2 provides computational access for software and data integration, and a graphical user interface that enables users to search for and share designs in a Web browser. By connecting to relevant repositories (e.g., the iGEM repository, JBEI ICE, and other instances of SynBioHub), the software allows users to browse, upload, and download data in various standard formats, regardless of their location or representation. SynBioHub also provides a central reference point for other resources to link to, delivering design information in a standardized format using the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL). The adoption and use of SynBioHub2, a community-driven effort, has the potential to overcome the reproducibility challenge across laboratories by helping to address the current lack of information about published designs.</p> <p>Also, SynBioHub2 can be used to publish a library of synthetic parts and designs as a service, to share designs with collaborators, and to store designs of biological systems locally. Data in SynBioHub2 can be accessed via the HTTP API, Java API, or Python API where it can then be integrated into CAD tools for building genetic designs. SynBioHub2 contains an interface for users to upload new biological data to the database, to visualize DNA parts, to perform queries to access desired parts, and to download SBOL, GenBank, FASTA, etc.</p> <p>The original version of SynBioHub can be found at https://synbiohub.org.</p>"},{"location":"5_background/about_synbiohub/#license","title":"License","text":"<p>SynBioHub2 is released using the BSD-2-Clause License.</p>"},{"location":"5_background/about_synbiohub/#citation","title":"Citation","text":"<p>If you use SynBioHub2, please cite the following papers:</p> <p>SynBioHub1:</p> <p>[1] J.

This includes for instance, but not limited to, simulation experiment descriptions, all models needed to run the simulations and associated data files. The archive is encoded using the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Component (Definition) Component (Definition) is used to represent biological design components such as DNA, RNA and small molecules. FASTA In bioinformatics and biochemistry, the FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or amino acid (protein) sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. The format also allows for sequence names and comments to precede the sequences. The format originates from the FASTA software package, but has now become a near universal standard in the field of bioinformatics. GFF3 The GFF (General Feature Format) format consists of one line per feature, each containing 9 columns of data, plus optional track definition lines. Image Image is a capture of the Visbol display at the top of the page. Plugin In computing, a plug-in (or plugin, add-in, addin, add-on, or addon) is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program. When a program supports plug-ins, it enables customization. They function in a way that is similar to browser extensions. They can be installed separately from the browser/SynBioHub and provide additional 'custom' functionality to the browser/SynBioHub experience despite having a completely separate code base from the browser/SynBioHub. SBOL The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology. URI A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules, but also maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme (e.g. http://). Web Of Registries Web of Registries concept i.e, the idea of multiple separate repositories linked together by shared common semantics. The Web Registry Service is a software component that supports the run-time discovery and evaluation of resources such as services, datasets, and application schemes."},{"location":"5_background/references/","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>McLaughlin, James Alastair, et al. \"SynBioHub: a standards-enabled design repository for synthetic biology.\" ACS synthetic biology 7.2 (2018): 682-688.</li> <li>Mante, Jeanet, Zach Zundel, and Chris J.
