This section contains definitions for various terminologies used in this documentation

|   Terminology      |     Description         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
|  **[Combine Archive](http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive)**  | A COMBINE archive is a single file containing the various documents (and in the future, references to documents), necessary for the description of a model and all associated data and procedures. This includes for instance, but not limited to, simulation experiment descriptions, all models needed to run the simulations and associated data files. The archive is encoded using the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX).            |
| **[Component (Definition)](https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#ComponentDefinition)** | Component (Definition) is used to represent biological design components such as DNA, RNA and small molecules. |
| **[FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format)**       | In bioinformatics and biochemistry, the FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or amino acid (protein) sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. The format also allows for sequence names and comments to precede the sequences. The format originates from the FASTA software package, but has now become a near universal standard in the field of bioinformatics.|
| **[GFF3](http://asia.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff3.html)**       | The GFF (General Feature Format) format consists of one line per feature, each containing 9 columns of data, plus optional track definition lines. |
| **Image**     | Image is a capture of the Visbol display at the top of the page.|
| **[Plugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing))** | In computing, a plug-in (or plugin, add-in, addin, add-on, or addon) is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program. When a program supports plug-ins, it enables customization. They function in a way that is similar to browser extensions. They can be installed separately from the browser/SynBioHub and provide additional 'custom' functionality to the browser/SynBioHub experience despite having a completely separate code base from the browser/SynBioHub. |
|  **[SBOL](https://sbolstandard.org/datamodel-about/)**             | The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology.          |
| **[URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier)** | A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules, but also maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme (e.g. http://).|
| **[Web Of Registries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Registry_Service)** | Web of Registries concept i.e, the idea of multiple separate repositories linked together by shared common semantics. The Web Registry Service is a software component that supports the run-time discovery and evaluation of resources such as services, datasets, and application schemes.|
