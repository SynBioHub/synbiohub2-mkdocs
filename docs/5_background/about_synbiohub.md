# About SynBioHub

SynBioHub2 is made of two intertwined projects:

1. Provides computational access for software and data integration, and a graphical user interface that enables users to search for, store, share, and publish genetic designs in a web application.
2. A public instance of the aforementioned software project at dev2.synbiohub.org, allowing users to upload and share designs.

The [SynBioHub2 repository](https://dev2.synbiohub.org) is an open-source software project that facilitates the sharing of information about engineered biological systems. SynBioHub2 provides computational access for software and data integration, and a graphical user interface that enables users to search for and share designs in a Web browser. By connecting to relevant repositories (e.g., the iGEM repository, JBEI ICE, and other instances of SynBioHub), the software allows users to browse, upload, and download data in various standard formats, regardless of their location or representation. SynBioHub also provides a central reference point for other resources to link to, delivering design information in a standardized format using the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL). The adoption and use of SynBioHub2, a community-driven effort, has the potential to overcome the reproducibility challenge across laboratories by helping to address the current lack of information about published designs.

Also, SynBioHub2 can be used to publish a library of synthetic parts and designs as a service, to share designs with collaborators, and to store designs of biological systems locally. Data in SynBioHub2 can be accessed via the HTTP API, Java API, or Python API where it can then be integrated into CAD tools for building genetic designs. SynBioHub2 contains an interface for users to upload new biological data to the database, to visualize DNA parts, to perform queries to access desired parts, and to download SBOL, GenBank, FASTA, etc.

The original version of SynBioHub can be found at [https://synbiohub.org](https://synbiohub.org).
